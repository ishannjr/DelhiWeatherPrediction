## Visualizing Data

The notebook (`WeatherDataDelhi.ipynb`) contains code to visualize the behavior of all columns in the Delhi weather dataset. This includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) and various plots to understand trends and patterns.

## Time Series Conversion

The notebook includes a function to convert the weather dataset into a time series dataset. Time series analysis is crucial for forecasting and understanding temporal patterns in the data.

## LSTM Model

The notebook builds a standard model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for time series prediction. LSTMs are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that are well-suited for sequence prediction tasks.

## Results and Predictions

The notebook contains functions to print the results of the LSTM model fitting process and to visualize the predicted values compared with the actual test values. This section is essential for evaluating the model's performance and gaining insights into its predictive capabilities.
